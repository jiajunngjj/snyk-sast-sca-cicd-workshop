# Workshop Steps

_NOTE_: It is assumed your using a mac for these steps, but it should also work on Windows or linux with some modifications to the scripts potentially.

## Step 1 - Fork the highly vulnerable Juice-Shop Application

_NOTE: You may have already forked the Juice-Shop application in that case go ahead and skip this step_

Navigate to the following GitHub repo - https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

_NOTE: this repo comes from the project Juice Shop from OWASP_

* Click on the "**Fork**" button
* Ensure you are forking this repo to your public GitHub account
* Click done

## Step 2 - Configure GitHub Integration

_NOTE: You may have already setup GitHub integration in that case go ahead and skip this step_

First we need to connect Snyk to GitHub so we can import our Repository. Do so by following these steps below:

* Login to http://app.snyk.io, sign up if you haven't already.
* Navigating to **Integrations** -> **Source Control** -> **GitHub**
* Fill in your Account Credentials to connect your GitHub Account.

![integration workshop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194023826-1cb8242f-0bc3-4776-8fd3-9b99cb723b87.png)

# Snyk Code Steps

Snyk Code is developer-first, embedding SAST as part of the development process, enabling developers to build software securely during development, not trying to find and fix problems after the code is compiled. Snyk Code works in the IDEs and SCMs developers use to build and review software and provides fast, actionable, meaningful results to fix issues in real-time

## Step 3 - Enable Snyk Code within Snyk App

* Click on the "**Settings**" button on the top most navigation bar as shown below

![setting_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194026233-ad7352b8-e00e-447d-8c27-e5601f4ceacd.png)

* Click on "**Snyk Code**", then enable it and click "**Save Changes**" as shown below

![snyk_code_setting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194027538-f121e536-f1a3-4e04-9124-f9326a33cbfc.png)

## Step 4 - Add project to find Snyk Code Vulnerabilities

Now that Snyk is connected to your GitHub Account, import the Forked Repo "**juice-shop**" into Snyk as a Project.

* Navigate to Projects
* Click "**Add Project**" then select "**GitHub**"
* Click on the Repo you forked "**juice-shop**"
* Click "**Add Selected Repositories**"

![alt tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194028382-cd12cc2c-aa2f-4cab-bc2f-d6525dee9099.png)

* Once complete you should see a "**Code Analysis**" project as shown below

![alt tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194032242-16b89a55-b96a-4137-91e9-4fe2a21ec52b.png)

* Click on "**Code Analysis**" to view our SAST scan results

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following:

1. Each Vulnerability grouped by severity
2. Each Vulnerability links to the CWE category code
3. Each Vulnerability shows the CWE category name
4. Displays the line of code where the security issue exists
5. Description for the issue and the code file name it exists in
6. A link to a Snyk Learn module on how to fix these type of vulnerabilities if available
7. The ability to ignore issues you wish to remove from the list

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/yk83tyP/Snyk-Code-vuln.png)

* Click on the "**Full Details**" button as shown below

Snyk products all provide a developer-friendly experience, so Snyk Code helps developers to quickly understand the problem, learn the background, and how to approach it. Snyk Code helps you understand the dangerous code flow step-by-step. For every issue, Code also provides a link to the lines in the relevant files, to view more details on the problem like the CWE, and how to approach it.

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/HnL22t7/Cross-site-scripting-Dataflow.png)

* Click on "**Fix Analysis**" to see how you can fix the issue based on other open source project. On this page you get not just source code example fixes but also the following detailed information

1. Details
2. Types Of Attacks
3. Affected Environments
4. How to prevent

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/M21xScH/Cross-site-scripting-Fix-Analysis.png)

# Snyk Open Source Steps

Snyk Open Source is a Software Composition Analysis took which seamlessly and proactively finds, prioritizes and fixes vulnerabilities and license violations in open source dependencies

## Step 5 - Find vulnerabilities

* Since Juice-Shop project had been imported in the Step 3, you should see multiple "**package.json**" projects as shown below.

![snyk_open_source](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194291603-cd7aa623-adc6-4cb8-a66b-83c20c55cc43.png)

* Click on the second "**package.json**" to view our Open Source scan results

First let's explore the Juice-Shop project risks by clicking on the "**package.json**" file which is the manifest file where the open source dependencies are declared.

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/ZhN6tXY/Package-json-view.png)

Then go back on the Snyk WebUI and let's have a look at the vulnerabilities.

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following ordered by our [Proprietary Priority Score](https://docs.snyk.io/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/snyk-priority-score) :
1. The module that introduced it and, in the case of transitive dependencies, its direct dependency,
1. Details on the path and proposed Remediation, as well as the specific vulnerable functions
1. Overview
1. Exploit maturity
1. Links to CWE, CVE and CVSS Score
1. Plus more ...

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/xq2GWCs/Snyk-OS-vuln.png)

## Step 6 - Fix using a Pull Request

When using the GitHub integration, and if a fix is available, Snyk can automatically upgrade the vulnerable dependency to a non-vulnerable version through a Pull Request.

* Click on "**Fix this vulnerability**" for "**Prototype Pollution**" issue as shown below

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/9NHPmn2/Snyk-OS-Fix-this-vuln.png)

* On the next screen, you'll be able to confirm the issue to fix with this PR. Click "**Open a Fix PR**"

![alt tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194293540-a854d9d6-4220-465f-9d49-a97534a84b3e.png)
![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/p2Lx5Rd/Open-fix-pr-button.png)

* Once it's ready, you'll be taken to the PR in GitHub, where you can review the changes in the file diff view:

Snyk integrates with your preferred Git repository to scan your manifest files for any new code and potential vulnerabilities whenever you submit a pull request (PR), protecting the security of your code before you ever merge it with the main branch

![alt tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194295151-e8204fca-d2fd-40cd-a87d-2cc9bc6ea4aa.png)

* We see that CI checks completed successfully, assuring us we didn't introduce a breaking change

![alt tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25560159/194295380-54dabfbd-1997-4afa-9243-1b416118f82d.png)

* Optionally now, go ahead and merge the PR!
* Back in Snyk we can appreciate that our package.json file has 1 less Critical Severity Vulnerability if you did fix it


# Snyk CLI (Optional)
### Step 7 - Run Snyk test using CLI (Optional)

In addition to the Snyk App UI we also have, snyk - CLI and build-time tool to find & fix known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies. The CLI is what is used in DevOps pipelines to introduce Application Security Scans as part of that workflow to push applications into production.

* Before we get started please make sure you have setup the Snyk CLI. There are various install options as per the links below. Using the prebuilt binaries means you don't have to install NPM to install the Snyk CLI.

1. Install Page - https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812538-Install-the-Snyk-CLI
1. Prebuilt Binaries - https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases

* In order to run a Snyk CLI test (Snyk Open Source) we must install the npm packages so if you have npm in your path you can install them as follows

Check your Node version:

```shell
$ node -v
```

_Note_: If you're using Node version v14.x or v16.x or v18.x, you can proceed to the next step (npm install), else please set up Node version 14 (Juice-Shop supported compatibility)

For MacOS brew user:
```shell
$ brew install node@14
$ export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@14/bin:$PATH"
```

For Windows/Linux nvm user:
```shell
$ nvm install 14
$ nvm list
$ nvm use version-number
```

With the right Node version, run:
```shell
$ npm install
```

_Note: If you don't have npm installed this you can skip this final step as a "snyk test" will not work without a **package-lock.json** file or the "**node_modules**" folder_

* Once npm is installed, authorize the Snyk CLI with your account as follows:

```bash
$ snyk auth

Now redirecting you to our auth page, go ahead and log in,
and once the auth is complete, return to this prompt and you'll
be ready to start using snyk.

If you can't wait use this url:
https://snyk.io/login?token=ff75a099-4a9f-4b3d-b75c-bf9847672e9c&utm_medium=cli&utm_source=cli&utm_campaign=cli&os=darwin&docker=false

Your account has been authenticated. Snyk is now ready to be used.
```

* Clone your forked repository as shown below. You can use your own GitHub forked repo here instead of the one shown below if you like

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jiajunngjj/juice-shop
Cloning into 'juice-shop'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (72676/72676), done.
```

* Change to the "**juice-shop**" directory

```shell
$ cd juice-shop
```
* Run Snyk Open Source test using CLI:

```shell
❯ snyk test --all-projects
